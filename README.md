# FAKE NEWS DETECTOR
CS521 Final Project: Ross Sheng and Futaba Kikuchi 

Script includes code to download csv data through pandas

4/15 Deliverable:

1. Count the number of fake and real news and make a bar graph for total number of fake and real news. 
We found that there is no big difference between the number of fake news and that of real news. 
It turned out that incorrect information was provided as much as the correct information.


2. Count a word in the text of fake news and real news and make a graph for word frequency. 
As we can see from the two graph, there is also no big difference between the word frequency in the text of fake news 
and that of real news. So we should remove the word like "the", "and", "to" and so on 
and make the same graphs and compare them.
